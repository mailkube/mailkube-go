# Engineering Standards: SOLID · DRY · KISS · Coverage · Docs

These are **enforced by CI** — a PR that violates them cannot merge. This file tells you the exact
thresholds and how to satisfy each gate locally *before* pushing.

## The gates

| Gate | Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage** | ≥ 90% (line/statement) | `go test ./... -coverprofile` + `scripts/check-coverage.sh` (the `test` CI job) |
| **DRY** | ≤ 1% duplicated code | `jscpd` (the `dry` CI job) |
| **KISS** | cyclomatic ≤ 10, cognitive ≤ 20 per unit | golangci-lint `gocyclo` / `gocognit` (the `test` CI job) |
| **Documentation** | every exported identifier + the package has a doc comment | golangci-lint `revive` (`exported`, `package-comments`) |
| **SOLID** | see below — approximated by lint + review | golangci-lint `unparam`/`gocritic`/`revive` + PR checklist |
| **Strict analysis** | no `staticcheck`/`govet`/`errcheck` findings | golangci-lint `standard` set (the `test` CI job) |
| **Formatting** | gofumpt-clean | `gofumpt -l .` (the `test` CI job) |

> **Coverage is line/statement only.** Go's tooling has no reliable branch-coverage metric, so this is
> a documented deviation from the python/node templates (which gate line **and** branch at 90%). Keep
> tests exercising every meaningful path anyway — the number is a floor, not a target.

## Run the gates locally

```bash
golangci-lint run                                  # complexity (KISS), docs, SOLID smells, staticcheck
gofumpt -l .                                        # formatting — must print nothing
go vet ./...                                        # vet
go test ./... -race -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=coverage.out
./scripts/check-coverage.sh coverage.out            # 90% coverage gate
npx --yes jscpd@4 --config .jscpd.json .            # duplication (DRY) gate
./scripts/check-rule-index.sh                       # every .rules/*.md indexed in AGENTS.md
```

`pre-commit run --all-files` runs the gofumpt + golangci-lint + jscpd + commitlint hooks in one shot.

## SOLID, concretely (paradigm-neutral guidance)

SOLID is not a single lint rule; keep these in mind and confirm them in the PR checklist:

- **S**ingle responsibility — a function/type does one thing; if you need "and" to describe it, split it.
- **O**pen/closed — extend via new functions/types/strategies, not by editing stable call sites.
- **L**iskov — implementations honor their interface's contract (return values, errors, invariants).
- **I**nterface segregation — small, focused interfaces; unused parameters (golangci `unparam`) are a smell.
- **D**ependency inversion — depend on a Go **interface** at I/O and network boundaries, and inject it.

## Requesting a waiver

If a threshold is genuinely wrong for a specific line, add a **scoped, commented** ignore
(e.g. `//nolint:gocyclo // parser dispatch, intentionally flat`) and call it out in the PR. Blanket
config relaxations (lowering the coverage threshold, disabling a linter globally) require maintainer sign-off.
